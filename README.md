Practical - Constructor

In this example, you are asked to define a Baby class.

Baby class properties -> Date of Birth, Name, Surname

Define 2 constructors for the Baby class.

The first is a method that does not take parameters in the Default Constructor style.

The second is an alternative constructor that takes the Name and Surname parameters and assigns the values ​​to the properties during the refresh process.

When the baby object is created jointly in the 2 Constructors, a " Ingaaaa " text should be seen on the console screen and the Date of Birth should be assigned as that moment.

After the definition, define a baby object with both constructors and print its properties to the console screen.
